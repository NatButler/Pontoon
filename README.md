# Pontoon

JavaScript implementation of the card game Pontoon. The UI allows you to play/learn the game from the perspective of each player. Created with the goal of exploring object-oriented programming - used to model the card deck and game - and a first foray into jQuery for DOM interactions and learning the pub/sub pattern.

## Instructions
